        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>8 (1-ounce) slices white bread (such as Wonder Bread®)</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
                    <li>4 thin slices sharp Cheddar cheese, halved</li>
                    <li>8 beef hot dogs (such as Oscar Mayer® Classic Wieners Hot Dogs)</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons minced yellow onion</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup barbecue sauce</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as Lawry’s®)</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Using a rolling pin, roll each bread slice until entirely flat. Trim just the crust off each bread slice, forming a 4x4-inch square. Spread each bread slice with an even layer of mustard (about 3/4 teaspoon per slice).</li>
                    <li>Working with 1 slice of bread at a time, place a halved cheese slice on the edge of the bread closest to you; place 1 hot dog horizontally on top of the cheese slice. If needed, trim the ends of the hot dog so that no hot dog extends over edges of bread. Spoon 1 1/2 teaspoons onion horizontally across the cheese slice above the hot dog, followed by 1 teaspoon of relish.</li>
                    <li>Roll up tightly, applying gentle pressure to help seal the bread seams together. Slice crosswise into 3 equal pieces (about 1 1/4-inches each), and transfer to a serving platter.</li>
                    <li>Repeat process with remaining ingredients. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes, or according to manufacturer's instructions. Lightly coat tops and sides of roll-ups with cooking spray. Working in 2 batches, add roll-ups to basket, spacing them 1/2-inch apart, and cook until bread is lightly golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir together barbecue sauce, mayonnaise, and seasoned salt in a small bowl until evenly combined.</li>
                    <li>Serve hotdog roll-ups with mayonnaise mixture.</li>
                </ol>
